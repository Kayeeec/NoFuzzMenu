# NoFuzzMenu

App for aggregating menus of restaurants in your area. 


App uses accessible APIs (Zomato) to collect information about menus in restaurants near a user-given location.
User can specify radius in which to search and maximum number of restaurants to show. 
The app offers shortcuts to restaurant's webpage and GoogleMaps navigation, as well as a quick overview
of restaurant rating, distance, cuisines and menu items.

Created as a project for the course PV239 at FI MU in Spring 2019.
